#' @title Perform Dimension Reduction to create EOFs.
#' @description \code{dim.red.EOFs} performs dimension reduction on a matrix using singular value decomposition to create a set of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs).
#' #'
#' @param X is a matrix, whose row vectors contain independent realisations of a stochastic process.  The number of columns in X represents the dimension of the process being observed.
#' @param numComponents is the number of dimensions to reduce X to and should be less than the number of columns in X.
#' @param percentageVariation is used to determine the number of EOFs to use if numComponents is not specified.  For example, specifying percentVariation = 0.95 will retain enough EOFs to account for 95% of the overall variation exibited in X.
#' @param plot is used to control whether or not to plot the percentage of variation explained as a function of the number of EOFs.
#'
#' @return the function returns a list containing two named objects: (i) v.dim.red is a matrix that contains coefficients that can be applied to the EOFs to (approximately) reconstruct each of the rows of X; and (ii) EOFs is a matrix that contains the EOFs in it's columns.  X is approximately equal to EOFs %*%  v.dim.red.
